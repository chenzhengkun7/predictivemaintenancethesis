\Acrfull{pdm} is a maintenance strategy where the maintenance actions are scheduled only when the subject is malfunctioning or is likely to fail soon.
\Acrshort{pdm} reduces costs and prevents downtime in comparison to classical preventive and reactive maintenance strategies.
\Acrshort{pdm} can be realized by using \acrfull{ai} techniques to build a model that predicts health state of the subject based on its condition monitoring data.
However, there exist various approaches to \acrshort{pdm} including fault detection, failure prediction and remaining useful life prediction, each having different data requirements and goals.
Each of the approaches utilizes different \acrshort{ai} techniques and should be evaluated using different evaluation metrics.
This thesis provides an overview of the approaches to \acrshort{pdm} to help the practitioners choose a suitable approach, \acrshort{ai} technique and evaluation metric for their problem at hand.
