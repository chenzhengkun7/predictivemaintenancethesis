\chapter{Approaches to Predictive Maintenance}
\label{chapter:approaches}

The goal of \gls{pdm} is to monitor and analyze condition of a subject in order to plan a maintenance action when the subject is faulty or a failure is likely to occur soon.
This can be achieved by using \gls{ml} algorithms and historical condition monitoring data to build a model that predicts the condition --- a \gls{pdm} model.
In this chapter we describe three main approaches how to build a \acrshort{pdm} model --- fault detection (Section \ref{sec:approaches_fd}), failure prediction (Section \ref{sec:approaches_failure_prediction}) and remaining useful life (Section \ref{sec:approaches_prognostics}).
We put an emphasis on the \gls{ml} techniques used in the individual approaches and the evaluation of the built models.
